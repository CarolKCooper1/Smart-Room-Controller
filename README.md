# Smart-Room-Controller
IoT Mid term project 
This is my **Smart Room Controller** midterm project for the Internet of Things course that I am taking. It is a room controller which uses sensors to control the lighting, temperature and humidity in the room. My room controller automatically controls the HUE lights in the room using a photodiode to increase the light when it senses dimness and decreasing light when it senses brightness. The controller also automatically uses inputs from the BME280 to adjust temperature and humidity using 2 wemo outlets. The OLED screens announce each of these changes in automatic mode while the 2nd OLED screen shows temperature, Barometric pressure, Humidity and shows the light reading from the photodiode. Neopixels add a fun splash of color on the board surrounded by a custom designed snake mini art piece. A third wemo outlet controls a spotlight lighting a unique art piece. 
In manual mode the encoder button turns the lights on and off. The humidifier, fan and spotlight are controlled using buttons.
